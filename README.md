LogMeIn test

I think it would be improve this app, in the following:
 - Remove just a certain element from cart.
 - A little bit designless :)
 - Animation when loading
 - Pagination 
 - UnitTest
 - Restful
 
 
 **.htaccess needed** 
 *but github doesn't support .htaccess file / you can not upload it*
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}index.html [QSA,L]
```
